# TriangleSquare


This is a java program to calculate the area of triangle and square where the values of the sides are passed as objects to the prorgram. We create an interface called Geometric Figure which contains abstract methods getArea, getPerimeter and print. These methods are implemented in the classes implementing GeometricFigure interface. We then create two classes called Triangle and Square. Then we create an applicaion that demonstrates creating objects {3 of each class} of both the classes and store them in an array. Then we print the area and perimeter of all six objects using for loop.
